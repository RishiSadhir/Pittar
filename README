* Introduction
  A command line utility used to compress a list of files/directories. Additionally, files/directories may be compressed then appeneded to an existing compressed file (.pitt file). One may completely or selectively decompress files to any desired location. All permissions are preserved.

* Compilation
  This program was compiled using gcc version 4.2. Versions prior to 4.0 will find trouble with the -fnested-functions flag that is required to compile this program.

* Usage
  pittar {-c|-a|-x|-m|-p} <archive-file> <file/directory list>
  

  where
   - c = compress
   - a = append
   - x = extract
   - m = print hierarchies
   - p = print metadata

* Problems
  None known. Prior to being flattened in to a single .pitt file, the files are first individually compressed into .Z files. This version does delete these .Z files as this archival tool was made for educational purposes and actually seeing the .Z files is quite elucidating. In practical use, one would likely want to modify the code to allow delete these .Z files after flattening.
